// Today I was working on dark mode for my personal website, alexlegard.ca.
// It is a work in progress though. I'll have something to show for it soon.

// I was getting my bearings for how the code for my website is structured
// since I haven't worked on it for a while.

// I had to figure out why changing certain colors wasn't possible using
// css files. Turns out I'm using Bootstrap, so I had to use certain class
// names like bg-light and bg-dark.
