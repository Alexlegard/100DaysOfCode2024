// Today, I mostly explored various articles and videos about React
// authentication. My React app had a branch with some code for
// auth0, but I really wasn't happy that I couldn't find a tutorial
// on auth0 that I was happy with.

// I changed my branch from "auth0" to master. Then I made sure I
// could run my React app and I booted up my laptop and did the
// exact same thing so I can run it fine on my laptop as well. Super
// important to make sure things were working before going to the
// next Coffee 'n' Code meetup.

// I found this tutorial series that looks promising by Dave Gray:

// The first video is about creating a registration form.

// I'll also mention I made a new resume this morning. Cool!
